This well-named repository is a little test program that I made to try out making a GUI with gtk+ using glade and python.

Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj_4So2DseI

TODO:
	Move window initialization from script to a function or class.
	Typing noises
	Rickroll
	Stopping the music on pink should cause a secret event.
	Allow any number of gifs automatically. (AKA get rid of hard coded numbers.)

Done:
	Make a flashing disco background
